# mooin_chrome_extension
Make mooin making more magnificent!

Making MOOCs with mooin can be a little frustrating at times ... Let's make it a little more comfortable with this Chrome extension! It will allow you to move lessons more easily, and it will hide some settings that you don't need to change for creating courses on mooin.

It's a hack. Changing the code of mooin/moodle would be much more sensible, and the extension will probably break if someone changes the design or some moodle plugins.
